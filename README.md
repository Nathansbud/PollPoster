# PollPoster

PollPoster was an attempt at automating Twitter polls that I created (and never used) back in 2019, when I got [really](https://twitter.com/kerokerobotnito), [really](https://twitter.com/DailyGrips), [really](https://github.com/Nathansbud/TuningFork/blob/master/lyricbot.py) into [polls](https://github.com/Nathansbud/PollExtracter) and [bots](https://github.com/Nathansbud/Wikipedaily) and [social media APIs](https://github.com/Nathansbud/KeywordStreamer) and...[data](https://github.com/Nathansbud/MessageAnalysis)?

Reviving this library 4 years later as a means of playing around with [instagrapi](https://adw0rd.github.io/instagrapi/), which wraps private Instagram API to expose things like story polls. I'd given up on creating daily instagram polls years ago, but now I am reinspired.
